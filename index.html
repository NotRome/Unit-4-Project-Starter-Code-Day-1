            <h2>Best Creations</h2>
            <p> <strong> <a class="Tt" href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla </a> </strong> </p>
            <p>Tesla is a car company currently led by it's CEO Elon Musk that mainly sells premium electric vehicles. Tesla has produced 5 cars starting with the roadster In 2008(No longer being sold), the model s in 2012, it's first luxury sedan, and would become the best selling plug In electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016. 2 years after the model s was made, (2014) , tesla introduced Autopilot a driver assistance system which allows the car to use sensors and cameras all around the car to help the driver and "drive by itself" turning, accelerating, decrescelerating at a set speed. Today, for 10000 dollars more, you can have the car download a software update to give it more driving capabilities such as summon, autopark, traffic light recognition and more. People who purchase this upgrade will be the first to experience full self driving, which tesla is currently working on to make possible and have released a self driving beta to a small number of customers. Tesla in September 2015, revealed the Model X, it's luxury suv. Teslas are rather expensive though and tesla released it's fourth vehicle in July 2017 called the model 3, a much cheaper vehicle appealing to most people starting at 35000. At the end of 2018, all issues with the early production of this car were ironed out and the model 3 was the best selling plug-in electric car of that year. The Model Y was released in March 2019 , a compact SUV that shares the majority of its components with the model 3. The cyber truck is an upcoming car revealed on september 2020 with an angular design.

            <p><strong><a class="Tt" href="https://www.tesla.com/solarpanels?energy_redirect=true">Solarcity</a></strong></p>
            <p> Solarcity is a company currently part of Tesla that makes and sells solar panels to be mounted on roofs. It originally began in 2006 with Peter and Lyndon Rive after their cousin Elon Musk suggested it and became a chairman and helped them. 3 years later the solar panels they were making were capable of generating 440 megawatts of power. Tesla announced in 2016, that they would be acquiring the company through a 2.6 dollar merger deal, since Tesla's mission is to "accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy" and Tesla now rents solar panels to six states for 50 dollars a month from August 2019. In July 2020, tela claimed that it is now the lowest cost solar in the us at the price of 1.49 per watt from solar panels including federal tax credits </p>
